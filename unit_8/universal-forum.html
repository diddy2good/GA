          <h1>Universal Forum</h1>
          <h2>Employer: Big Fish Games</h2>

          <p>Due to NDA compliance, key information regarding Big Fish Games will be omitted.</p>

          <p>The Universal Forum project is intended to be a universal layout for our internal game studio to use when they wanted to create a forum for one of their games. The forum itself would not be created in house, as we worked with a 3rd party to manage our forums.</p>

          <h3>Tech limitations</h3>
          <p>Like all projects, it's always a great start to identify if you have any limitations. This project did have it's limitations.</p>
          <p>First limitation, I have to use the 3rd party that Big Fish Games already paid for the forum service. This service was not going to be creating any new functionality for their forum service, as we were needed to select from their existing forum options.</p>

          <p>Second limitation, the new forum design must be compatible with an existing forum being used by an existing game.</p>

            <figcaption>The most current version of Dungeon Boss Forum. </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h3>Forum options</h3>
          <p>After learning what my limitations were, I wanted to reach out to the studio team figure out what type of forum they believed could be useful for them and their game. I also researched some existing forums that the 3rd party service we're using has done.</p>
          <p>Once I gathered some nice options for look and feel of the forums, I started to review the 3rd party's "Addons". These Addons are the 3rd party's forum options. While reviewing these addons, I noticed that they were a mix of what a user would see, what a moderator would see, and options for backend reporting.</p>
          <p>Considering that I would need to maintain consideration for our existing forum for Dungeon Boss, I reached out to the moderators to see which addons they use and how they felt about them.</p>
          <p>With the idea of supporting future games, I identified some of the producers for these games and presented them a card sort hosted by Optimal Workshop to identify which forum addons they would find useful.</p>

          <h3>Next Step in Universalizing</h3>
          <p>My next step to making the forums universal is creating a standard on discussion categories. The reason is because when viewing what Dungeon Boss did, the categories were very game specific.</p>
          <p>So I took note of every category and created an open card sort using Optimal Workshop. I took this sorting exercise and shared it internally with the employees.</p>

            <figcaption>Card sort results, general group highlighted</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Based off the results, I created a first click test using Optimal Workshop to see if the users could take common tasks and identify where to find the appropriate category.</p>

          <h3>Apply to designs</h3>
          <p>Now I take my data and create a wireframes</p>

          </figure>

          <h4>MISCOMMUNICATION</h4>
          <p>Once I've finalized my wireframes and send them to the 3rd party, I learn that they don't "design" and everything must sumbitted in PSD files, and pixel perfect.</p>

          <h4>MISCOMMUNICATION #2</h4>
          <p>The 3rd party also requires a default view of the forum that will be intially stamped first before a game producer could change the values to personalize the forum to their game.</p>

            <figcaption>High fidelity comp of the forum design. This is what will be used as a default design for each new forum</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h3>Results</h3>
          <p>The designs were submitted. Unofortunately the submitted changes were never carried out completetly for the existing game, and none of the new games utilized the forum services.</p>
