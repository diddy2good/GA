          <p>I enjoy building anything from a perfect breakfast sandwich to an easy-to-use product experience. As a builder, I enjoy every aspect from conceptualizing to final delivery.</p>
          <p>Today I am currently working as a UX Designer at Big Fish Games and create design solutions for internal products. I partner with engineering, marketers, and product management to create a perfect balance between user and business needs.</p>
          <p>As I grow my skills as a Designer I am also pushing my boundaries as a developer. For example, this website was built by me.</p>
